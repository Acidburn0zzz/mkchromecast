This is a program to cast your **Mac OS X** audio, or **Linux** audio to your
Google Cast devices.

It is written in Python, and it streams via `node.js`, or `ffmpeg`.
**mkchromecast** is capable of using lossy and lossless audio formats provided
that `ffmpeg` is installed. Additionally, a system tray menu is also available.

By default, **mkchromecast** streams with `node.js` (or `ffmpeg` in **Linux**)
together with `mp3` audio coding format at a sample rate of `44100Hz` and
average bitrate of `192k`.  These defaults can be changed using the
`--sample-rate` and `-b` flags. It is useful to modify these parameters when
your wireless router is not very powerful like mine, or in the case you don't
want to degrade the sound quality.  For more information [visit the
wiki](https://github.com/muammar/mkchromecast/wiki/).

For **Linux**, you have to install `ffmpeg` and `pulseaudio` (see the [wiki for
more information](https://github.com/muammar/mkchromecast/wiki/Linux)).
Sometimes the lag between a song plays and hearing may be of 8 seconds. I don't
know if it is my router though.

### Requirements:

#### Mac OS X

In order to use **mkchromecast** you need the following software to stream with
`node.js`:

* Python2 (already shipped in OS X), or Python3.
* pychromecast.
* psutil.
* mutagen.
* [Soundflower](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/).
* py_getch (optional if you want to control the volume of the Google cast
  device).
* PyQt5 (optional if you want to use the system tray menu).

For more control, you need `ffmpeg` as backend.  In that case install
following:

* flask (optional).
* ffmpeg (optional).

#### Linux

* Pulseaudio.
* Python2, or Python3.
* pychromecast.
* psutil.
* mutagen.
* flask.
* ffmpeg.
* py_getch (optional if you want to control the volume of the Google cast
  device).
* PyQt5 (optional if you want to use the system tray menu).

### Installing and updating

To install **mkchromecast**, clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/muammar/mkchromecast.git
```

Or you may download one of the [stable releases
here](https://github.com/muammar/mkchromecast/releases), and unzip the file.

#### Python

To install the python requirements use the `requirements.txt` file shipped in
this repository:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: if this step fails, maybe you need to run the installation with
`sudo` as shown below. However, before installing using this method verify why
a regular user cannot install the requirements.

```
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Linux** users can try to install these python requirements using the package
managers coming with their distributions.

#### Soundflower (Mac users only)

For Soundflower you can check
[https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/)
or if you have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) you can use [brew
cask](https://caskroom.github.io/) as follows:

```
brew cask install soundflower
```

Or just download the [latest dmg
file](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases).

By default, the sample rate in Soundflower is set to `44100Hz`. If you desire
to stream at higher sample rates follow the [instructions in the wiki](https://github.com/muammar/mkchromecast/wiki/Soundflower).

**Note**: resampling to higher sample rates is not a good idea. It was indeed
an issue in the chromecast audio. See [this thread](https://goo.gl/yNVODZ).
Therefore, if you want to go beyond `44100Hz` you have to [capture the sound at
a higher sample rate](https://github.com/muammar/mkchromecast/wiki/Soundflower).

#### ffmpeg

The easiest way of installing `ffmpeg` is using a package manager, *e.g.*: brew,
macports or fink. Or in the case of Linux, *e.g.*: apt, yum, or pacman.

##### Mac OS X

I will briefly describe the case of Homebrew here. First, you will need
Homebrew:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Once Homebrew is ready, you can install `ffmpeg`.  As stated in the [ffmpeg
website](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/MacOSX), and for using
all audio coding formats in **mkchromecast**, it is better to install some
additional `ffmpeg`'s options:

```
brew install ffmpeg --with-fdk-aac --with-ffplay --with-freetype --with-libass --with-libquvi --with-libvorbis --with-libvpx --with-opus --with-x265
```

##### Linux

As I use Debian, the way of installing `ffmpeg` is:

```
apt-get install ffmpeg
```

With `ffmpeg`, the following audio coding formats are available:

**Audio coding format** | **Description**                   | **Notes**
------------------------| ----------------------------------|------------------
  `mp3`                 | MPEG Audio Layer III (default)    | Lossy compression format (default bitrate: 192k)
  `ogg`                 | Ogg Vorbis                        | Lossy compression format (default bitrate: 192k)
  `aac`                 | Advanced Audio Coding (AAC)       | Lossy compression format (default bitrate: 192k)
  `wav`                 | Waveform Audio File Format        | Lossless format (HQ sound)
  `flac`                | Free Lossless Audio Codec         | Lossless format (HQ sound)

Example using wav:

```
python mkchromecast.py --encoder-backend ffmpeg -c wav
```

There is also an option to change the `bitrate`:

```
python mkchromecast.py --encoder-backend ffmpeg -c ogg -b 128
```

and another one to change the sampling rate:

```
python mkchromecast.py --encoder-backend ffmpeg -c ogg -b 128 --sample-rate 48000
```
check [https://github.com/muammar/mkchromecast#soundflower](https://github.com/muammar/mkchromecast#soundflower).

The `--encoder-backend` flag is useless for Linux users for the moments though
I plan to give support to `avconv`.

#### PyQt5

These Python bindings are needed if you intend to use the system tray menu. As
of today April 28th, `pip` is able to install `pyqt5`. Therefore, you can do
a `pip install pyqt5`.

If this does not work for you, I suggest you to install it using a package
manager.

##### Mac OS X

Example with Homebrew:

```
brew install pyqt5 --with-python
```

##### Linux

###### Debian

For Python2:

```
apt-get install python-pyqt5
```

For Python3:

```
apt-get install python3-pyqt5
```

or if you desire it you can do it yourself from the sources.

#### Updating

To update **mkchromecast**, just get into the cloned directory and:

```
git pull
```

### How to execute it

Get into the cloned **mkchromecast** directory and execute:

```
python mkchromecast.py
```

This will launch **mkchromecast** using `node.js` (or `ffmpeg` for **Linux**
users), and will do the streaming part together with the `mp3` audio coding
format.  `node.js` works decently, **however** I would like to point out that
the node version of this implementation is ancient. Moreover, the `node.js`
server tends to _fail_. In such a case, **mkchromecast** is able to restart the
streaming/casting process automatically. So, some hiccups are expected.

**Note**: most of the steps described herein are the same for Mac and Linux
users. However, if your platform is **Linux**, the process is less automatized.
You need to select with `pavucontrol` the sink called `mkchromecast` to stream.
See the [wiki for more information](https://github.com/muammar/mkchromecast/wiki/Linux).

#### Using the `ffmpeg` backend

Below an example using `mp3` with `ffmpeg`:

```
python mkchromecast.py --encoder-backend ffmpeg
```

This is way more stable than the `node` implementation. With `ffmpeg` you can
modify the codec:

```
python mkchromecast.py --encoder-backend ffmpeg -c aac
```

change the bitrate and sample rate:

```
python mkchromecast.py --encoder-backend ffmpeg -c mp3 -b 128 --sample-rate 31000
```

#### Playing Youtube URLs in Google Cast TV

You can play Youtube URLs headlessly from the command line:

```
python mkchromecast.py -y https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=NVvAJhZVBT
```

**Note**: you may need to enclose the URL between quotation marks. This does
not work in Google Cast audio.

#### Controlling the Google Cast volume

You can control the volume of your Google Cast device by launching
**mkchromecast** with the option `--volume`:

```
python mkchromecast.py --encoder-backend ffmpeg -c ogg -b 320 --volume
```

This will allow you to press <kbd>u</kbd> and <kbd>d</kbd> keys for `volume up`
and `volume down` respectively.

**Note**: you need the module `py-getch` for this option to work. You can
install it using the `requirements.txt` file shipped in the repository as
described above.

#### More help

To get more help:

```
python mkchromecast.py -h
```

### Killing the application

To kill **mkchromecast** when you run it from console, there are two ways of
doing it: if you didn't use the `--volume` option, just press
<kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd>. Otherwise, you will need to press the
<kbd>q</kbd> key to quit.

#### Notes

A **beta** system tray menu is now provided. It requires you to install
`PyQt5`. To launch it:

```
python mkchromecast.py -t
```

It looks like:

![Image of
working menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muammar/mkchromecast/master/images/screenshot.png)

**Note**: you can pass the options when using `ffmpeg` as backend and adding `-t`
to launch the system tray. I am still working on improving all of this.

### TODO

* Verify all exceptions when the system tray menu fails.
* Check that the index of the cast selected is correctly passed in the
system tray.
* Generate a standalone Mac OS X application.
* Video?.
