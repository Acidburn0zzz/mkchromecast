mkchromecast
============

This is a tiny program to cast your **Mac OS X** audio to your google cast
devices. It is written in Python, and it streams using node.js for the moments.

For Linux you have a program called
[pulseaudio-dlna](https://github.com/masmu/pulseaudio-dlna) that does this
beautifully.

## Requirements:

In order to use **mkchromecast** you need the following:

* Python2 (already shipped in OS X), or Python3.
* pychromecast.
* psutil.
* [Soundflower](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/).

#### Python

this repository:
