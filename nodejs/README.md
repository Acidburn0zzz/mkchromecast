Building node and npm
=====================

This directory contains all related to nodejs. **mkchromecast**  ships a local
version of `node` and also `npm` to operate correctly and ease the updating of
`node_modules` directory.

To build node, just execute;

```
./recompile_node.sh
```

This will install the package at `mkchromecast/nodejs/node-6.2.2`.
